## Stuff to install first
* [A Particle account](https://login.particle.io/)
* The Particle mobile app for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/particle-iot/id991459054) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.particle.android.app&hl=en_US)
* [Particle Workbench](https://particle.io/workbench)

**This tutorial is based on the [air quality kit tutorial available from Particle](https://docs.particle.io/quickstart/aqmk-project/).** I strongly recommend reading through that tutorial before you get started.

## Get started: assembling and pairing your device
**I've put together a Youtube video that will help you assemble your device:**
[![Assembling and Pairing Particle Microcontroller](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakehosen/Ecological_Sensors/master/assembly_youtube.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPB4ETfzj9M&t=440s "Particle Assembly")

Great, so now you've put together your device it's time to program your device.

## Programming your Particle Argon microcontroller
Now that you have the device assembled and paired, you want to plug it into the computer using the USB cable that was supplied. Next open up the Particle Workbench (do this by opening Visual Studio Code -- commonly referred to as VS Code). When you've done that, you'll be ready to follow along with the tutorial in this next video. I recommend watching the video and then try it for yourself with the air quality kit tutorial and the video as reference.
[![Programming your Particle Argon](https://github.com/jakehosen/Ecological_Sensors/raw/master/particle_programming_youtube.png)]( https://youtu.be/htxbdjW4TLk  "Particle Programming")

Okay, now that you've completed the work in this video, your sensor package is collecting data and sending those data to the cloud. The problem is that now we have to actually save our data to the cloud somewhere. That's the next exciting part.

## I tried to follow the tutorial and video, but I'm getting stuck
That's totally fine. I've included a working version of the code below. Watch this video and I'll explain how to get started very quickly using this code snippet.

**NOTE:** The point of this class is to learn how to use these devices in a functional matter. That means I suggest at least trying to work through the code as I describe above and is in the tutorial. That said, it is a little tricky and because we are working remotely it's not as easy to work through problems remotely. So if you give the above information a shot and it doesn't work, go ahead and use the script below, but do try to work through the material above -- I think you'll find it beneficial.

**Here's the video explaining how to load the code snippet below onto your Particle Argon:**

**Here's the code that you past into VS Code following the instructions in the video:**
