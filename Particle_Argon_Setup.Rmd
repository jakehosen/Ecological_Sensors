```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Stuff to install first
* [A Particle account](https://login.particle.io/)
* The Particle mobile app for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/particle-iot/id991459054) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.particle.android.app&hl=en_US)
* [Particle Workbench](https://particle.io/workbench)

## Get started assembling your device
**this tutorial is based off the )air quality kit tutorial available from Particle)[https://docs.particle.io/quickstart/aqmk-project/]. I strongly recommend reading through that tutorial before you get started.**

I've put together a Youtube video that will help you assemble your device:
[![Assembling and Pairing Particle Microcontroller](https://docs.particle.io/assets/images/argon-kit-looped-antenna-docs-crop.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPB4ETfzj9M&t=440s "Particle Assembly")




## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
