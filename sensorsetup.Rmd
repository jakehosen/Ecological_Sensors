## Stuff to install first
* [A Particle account](https://login.particle.io/)
* The Particle mobile app for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/particle-iot/id991459054) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.particle.android.app&hl=en_US)
* [Particle Workbench](https://particle.io/workbench)

**This tutorial is based on the [air quality kit tutorial available from Particle](https://docs.particle.io/quickstart/aqmk-project/).** I strongly recommend reading through that tutorial before you get started.

## Get started: assembling and pairing your device
**I've put together a Youtube video that will help you assemble your device:**
[![Assembling and Pairing Particle Microcontroller](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakehosen/Ecological_Sensors/master/assembly_youtube.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPB4ETfzj9M "Particle Assembly")

Great, so now you've put together your device it's time to program your device.

## Programming your Particle Argon microcontroller
Now that you have the device assembled and paired, you want to plug it into the computer using the USB cable that was supplied. Next open up the Particle Workbench (do this by opening Visual Studio Code -- commonly referred to as VS Code). When you've done that, you'll be ready to follow along with the tutorial in this next video. I recommend watching the video and then try it for yourself with the air quality kit tutorial and the video as reference.
[![Programming your Particle Argon](https://github.com/jakehosen/Ecological_Sensors/raw/master/particle_programming_youtube.png)]( https://youtu.be/htxbdjW4TLk  "Particle Programming")

Okay, now that you've completed the work in this video, your sensor package is collecting data and sending those data to the cloud. The problem is that now we have to actually save our data to the cloud somewhere. That's the next exciting part.

## I tried to follow the tutorial and video, but I'm getting stuck
That's totally fine. I've included a working version of the code below. Watch this video and I'll explain how to get started very quickly using this code snippet.

**NOTE:** The point of this class is to learn how to use these devices in a functional matter. That means I suggest at least trying to work through the code as I describe above and is in the tutorial. That said, it is a little tricky and because we are working remotely it's not as easy to work through problems remotely. So if you give the above information a shot and it doesn't work, go ahead and use the script below, but do try to work through the material above -- I think you'll find it beneficial.

**Here's the video explaining how to load the code snippet below onto your Particle Argon:**

## Configuring a webhook.
Now that your data are being streamed to the Particle's servers on the web, we need to tell the servers where we're going to store the data. We do this with a webhook that essentially reroutes our data.

To setup a webhook, go to [console.particle.io](http://console.particle.io) and login with the account you've created. On the left side of the webpage are a bunch of icons that have labels that pop up when you hover the mouse over them. Click on the one that says "integrations". When you do that you will see a page like the one below. Click on the box with the (+) labeled "New Integration":

![The Particle Console screen for setting up new web integrations (e.g., webhooks)](new_integration.png)

From here, we are going to configure a webhook, so click on the box labeled webhook on the next page (as seen below).
![Page for selecting the type of integration being used (here we are using a webhook)](add_webhook.png)
Once you have clicked this button, you will see a webform like the one below. We will enter information about the GeoEDF server at MyGeoHub that will be receiving our data in this webform. This will tell the Particle servers how to forward the data collected on our sensors to the database hosted at [mygeohub.org](http://mygeohub.org).
![Here's what the webhook setup form looks like when it's blank](webhook_blank.png)

You should fill out the form like you see below. The event name should be "env-vals", the url should be "http://149.165.157.202:4792/aqsensors/data", the request type should be set to "POST", the request format should be set to "JSON" and the device can be set to "Any" since we have a device ID parameter in the JSON object to keep track of each device. When you are done your form should look like the one below.
![Configuring a webhook for GeoEDF](webhook_geoedf_url.png)

Now, click on *Advanced Settings*. Click the radio button under JSON that says "Custom" and then paste the following code into the resulting textbox. When you're done your page should look like the picture below.

```{c eval=FALSE}
{
  "method": "insert",
  "data": "{{{PARTICLE_EVENT_VALUE}}}",
  "coreid": "{{{PARTICLE_DEVICE_ID}}}",
  "published_at": "{{{PARTICLE_PUBLISHED_AT}}}"
}
```


![Configuring advanced settings for the webhook for GeoEDF](webhook_geoedf_json.png)

Now you have one more thing to do. Scroll back to the top and select "CUSTOM TEMPLATE". From there you want to paste the following code into the text box labeled "Particle webhook template reference". When you are done and your page looks like below, you are ready to hit SAVE!

```{c eval=FALSE}
{
    "event": "env-vals",
    "url": "http://149.165.157.202:4792/aqsensors/data",
    "requestType": "POST",
    "noDefaults": true,
    "rejectUnauthorized": false,
    "json": {
        "method": "insert",
        "data": "{{{PARTICLE_EVENT_VALUE}}}",
        "coreid": "{{{PARTICLE_DEVICE_ID}}}",
        "published_at": "{{{PARTICLE_PUBLISHED_AT}}}"
    }
}
```
